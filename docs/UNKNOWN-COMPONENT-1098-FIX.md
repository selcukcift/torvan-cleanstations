# Fix for Unknown Component #1098 in Pre-Rinse Overhead Spray Unit Kit

## Issue Analysis ✅

You correctly identified that the "Unknown Component" appears to be an **extra item** rather than a missing one. Your observation is spot on!

### What We Found:

The assembly `T2-OA-PRE-RINSE-FAUCET-KIT` has **4 component links** in the database:
1. ✅ B-0133-A10-B08 - Pre-rinse Combo Faucet
2. ✅ B-0230-K - 1/2" NPT Nipple Kit  
3. ✅ PFX146332 - 3/8 C X 1/2 FIP Sink Connector
4. ❌ **Component Link #1098 - BROKEN (Both childPartId and childAssemblyId are NULL)**

### According to Resource Files:

The `resources/assemblies.json` shows this kit should only have **3 components**:
```json
"T2-OA-PRE-RINSE-FAUCET-KIT": {
  "components": [
    { "part_id": "B-0133-A10-B08", "quantity": 1 },
    { "part_id": "B-0230-K", "quantity": 1 },
    { "part_id": "PFX146332", "quantity": 1 }
  ]
}
```

## Root Cause 🔍

The "Unknown Component" is caused by a **broken database record** in the `AssemblyComponent` table:

```sql
-- This broken record exists:
id: 1098
parentAssemblyId: "T2-OA-PRE-RINSE-FAUCET-KIT"
childPartId: NULL        -- ❌ Should reference a part
childAssemblyId: NULL    -- ❌ Or reference an assembly
quantity: 1
```

**A component link must reference either a Part OR an Assembly, but this one references neither!**

## Why This Happens 🤔

This typically occurs due to:
1. **Data migration issues** - Incomplete imports
2. **Manual database edits** - Incorrect SQL statements
3. **Application bugs** - Component creation without proper child reference
4. **Cascading deletes** - A part/assembly was deleted but the link remained

## The Fix 🔧

### Option 1: Remove the Broken Link (Recommended)
Since the resource file confirms only 3 components are needed:

```bash
cd "/media/selcuk/project files/Clean-stations"

# First, analyze the issue
node scripts/fix-broken-component-links.js

# Then fix it
node scripts/fix-broken-component-links.js --fix
```

### Option 2: Manual Database Fix
```sql
-- Remove the specific broken link
DELETE FROM "AssemblyComponent" 
WHERE id = 1098 
  AND "childPartId" IS NULL 
  AND "childAssemblyId" IS NULL;
```

## Expected Result 🎯

### Before Fix:
```
Pre-rinse Overhead Spray Unit Kit (4 components)
├── Unknown Component (UNKNOWN_COMPONENT_1098) ❌
├── Pre-rinse Combo Faucet
├── 1/2" NPT Nipple Kit
└── 3/8 C X 1/2 FIP Sink Connector
```

### After Fix:
```
Pre-rinse Overhead Spray Unit Kit (3 components)
├── Pre-rinse Combo Faucet
├── 1/2" NPT Nipple Kit
└── 3/8 C X 1/2 FIP Sink Connector
```

## Prevention 🛡️

To prevent this in the future:
1. **Database constraints** - Add check constraints to ensure component links always have a child reference
2. **Application validation** - Validate component creation to require either partId or assemblyId
3. **Regular audits** - Run the broken link detector periodically
4. **Import validation** - Verify data integrity during imports/migrations

## Technical Details 📝

The BOM service creates "Unknown Component" entries when it encounters these broken links:

```typescript
if (!part && !childAssembly) {
  console.warn(`No linked part or assembly found for component...`)
  bomItem.components!.push({
    id: `UNKNOWN_COMPONENT_${componentLink.id}`,  // Creates UNKNOWN_COMPONENT_1098
    name: `Unknown Component`,
    // ...
  })
}
```

Your intuition was correct - this is not a missing part that needs to be added, but rather an invalid database record that needs to be removed!
