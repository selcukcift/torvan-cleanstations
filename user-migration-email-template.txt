Subject: Action Required: Upgrade to New Torvan Medical CleanStation Login System

Dear [USER_NAME],

We've upgraded our CleanStation workflow system with a new, more secure authentication system. To continue accessing the system, you need to create a new account using your existing email address.

**IMPORTANT: Your existing data, roles, and permissions will be preserved.**

**What You Need to Do:**

1. Go to: http://localhost:3005/sign-up
2. Sign up using your EXISTING EMAIL ADDRESS: [USER_EMAIL]
3. Create a new secure password
4. Your account will be automatically linked to your existing profile

**Your Account Details:**
- Full Name: [USER_FULL_NAME]
- Email: [USER_EMAIL] ← Use this email to sign up
- Current Username: [USERNAME] (you won't need this anymore)
- Role: [USER_ROLE]

**Benefits of the New System:**
✅ More secure authentication
✅ Better password security
✅ Modern user interface
✅ All your existing work data preserved

**Timeline:**
Please complete this migration within the next 7 days. After that, the old login system will be disabled.

**Need Help?**
If you have any questions or issues during the signup process, please contact your system administrator.

**Technical Notes:**
- You will log in with your EMAIL address instead of username
- You can set a new, secure password
- All your orders, tasks, and data remain unchanged
- Your role and permissions stay the same

Thank you for your cooperation in this security upgrade.

Best regards,
Torvan Medical IT Team
